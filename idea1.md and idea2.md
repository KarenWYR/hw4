Pinball
There was a computer game that brought up the heat in our childhood back in 2010 which is called 3D Pinball Space Cadet. It’s my childhood and is supposed to be a lot of other Chinese students’ childhood in their computer class back in elementary or middle school.
In this ideation, I’m thinking of building up the same gaming flow as 3D Pinball Space Cadet which I would probably use a lot of “random” function when the ball hits other elements on the screen. The player uses the keyboard to control the two arms for flipping the ball, and if the ball gets into a tube, the player wins; if the ball drops down the gap, the player loses. The sound would be applied when the arm hits the ball as well as the ball hits other elements.

This idea is not mature enough yet but I’m really interested in it. It’s an instrument idea of drawing a flute on the canvas with all the holes on it. Having different keys controlling different holes and when the keys are pressed, the sound of that specific tone comes out. Players could create their own flute music with freestyling it or follow a key pressing instruction (music score) that is written on the canvas to play a professional song.
This idea is inspired by a TV show that I recently watched called The Untamed which a really beautiful flute song is emphasized in it. Even though I don’t know anything about how a flute works, I would love to learn it quickly and try to make this process work out.
